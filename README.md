Sentiment Analysis (of Amazon Product Reviews):
This repository contains a Python program developed as part of a Capstone Project focusing on sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews. 
The aim of this project was to explore how machine learning techniques, specifically using the spaCy library, can be leveraged to determine 
the semantic meaning of words used in product reviews. The project spanned over 5 days and involved extensive testing and development to 
accurately predict sentiment based on the text data. Despite its demanding nature, the project was both challenging and rewarding, offering 
insights into the capabilities of natural language processing in extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text data.
