Sentiment Analysis (of Amazon Product Reviews):
This repository contains a Python program developed as part of a Capstone Project (Hyperiondev/CoGrammar Data Science Course) 
focusing on sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews. The aim of this project was to explore how machine learning techniques, 
specifically using the spaCy library, can be leveraged to determine the semantic meaning of words used in product reviews. The 
project spanned over 5 days and involved extensive testing and development to accurately predict sentiment based on the text data. 
Despite its demanding nature, the project was both challenging and rewarding, offering insights into the capabilities of natural 
language processing in extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text data. It can be used to analyse any database or more 
likely certain section/column/row of database. In case of use with another database (.csv/.txt/etc.) some minor adjustments 
will be needed (Datasets/DataFrame) to extract data for further semantic analysis. Thanks everyone in Hyperiondev and CoGrammar
for making such interesting task. That was fun! :)
