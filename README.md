### Sentiment Analysis (of Amazon Product Reviews)
This repository contains a Python program developed as part of a Capstone Project (Hyperiondev/CoGrammar Data Science Course) 
focusing on sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews (source file/database also included). The aim of this project was to 
explore how machine learning techniques, specifically using the spaCy library, can be leveraged to determine the semantic 
meaning of words used in product reviews. The project spanned over 5 days and involved extensive testing and development to 
accurately predict sentiment based on the text data. Despite its demanding nature, the project was both challenging and 
rewarding, offering insights into the capabilities of natural language processing in extracting meaningful insights from 
unstructured text data. It can be used to analyse any database or more likely certain section/column/row of database. In 
case of use with another database (.csv/.txt/..) some minor adjustments will be needed (Datasets/DataFrame/subset/..) 
to extract data for further analysis. Thanks everyone in Hyperiondev/CoGrammar staff for making such an interesting task. 
That was fun! :)
